> measure the usage of and calc costs accordingly:
    [done] electricity (type 1), Mo - Fr, 23:00 - 07:00, 0,18/kWh
    [done] electricity (type 1), Mo - Fr, 07:00 - 23:00, 0,20/kWh
    [done] electricity (type 1), Weekend, 23:00 - 07:00, 0,18/kWh
    [done] electricity (type 1), Weekend, 07:00 - 23:00, 0,18/kWh
    [done] gas (type 2), 23:00 - 07:00, 0,06/kWh
    [done] gas (type 2), 07:00 - 23:00, 0,06/kWh
        > is simplified ;o )

> readings interval
    [done] check if interval of 15 minutes is correct
    [done] timestamps format needs conversion
        * unix to time
    [done] timestamps needs to be compared
    [done] usage = reading[i + 1] - reading[i]

> calculate the total cost for all usages per metering_point_id
    > metering points can return errors
        [done] incorrect reading is negative usage or usage is gt 100
        [done] filter incorrect readings before (final) calc
            > filtering is
                * skip incorrect reading value
                * consume linearly (usage between two correct readings is divided equally per 15 min)
    [done] readings are in Wh and m3 and need to be converted to kWh
    [done] cost per usage needs to be summed per metering_point_id
